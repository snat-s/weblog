Today I watched the talk from Rohan Pandej. It's pretty good! My first time
reading more about how indian natural language processing endedup influencing our
current thought process on NLP.

Theres this quote from the talk:

> The linguistics of India more than two millenia ago was the direct germinal origin
> of the linguistics of the West today.
> - M.B. Emeneu, Founder of UC Berkeley Linguistics Department, 1955

Also, I really want to learn more about
[GLOM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12627), which looks like an architecture that
learns to process images with islands of identrical high-dimensional embedding
vectors. Its developed by Geoffrey Hinton (the intern from Google with a Nobel)
but it seems to be forgotten through time. I don't know if it never endedup
grabbing anyones attention but most likely I'll read it and post a summary over
the week.


If you want to watch the talk, its right here:
