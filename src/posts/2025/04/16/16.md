I've been thinking a lot about how friction on interactions can make
you leave bad habits. So I decided to make my own tiny version of the
extension that forces you to just wait for 5 seconds at the very least
to enter any website on the internet.

I've been using it for about an hour and I have realized that I tend to
enter a bunch of websites almost uncosciously. It's nice to have a break like
this to actually think if I want to enter the website or not.

Below is a gif of how this works:

Right now it leaves in my monorepo m, right
[here](https://github.com/snat-s/m/tree/main/waiter). If you want to download
and use it you have to open the folder and do the following things:

If you are in chrome:

1. Go to `chrome:://extensions`
2. Enable Developer Mode on the top right corner.
3. Click on 'Load Unpacked' and select the `waiter` directory.
4. Thats it!

I really created this for me but I am open sourcing it if anyone finds it helpful.
