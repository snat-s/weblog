It's been really annoying to always have to crosspost around Bluesky and X.
So I decided to fix it. I created a tiny script that uses the X and Bsky APIs
respectively to crosspost through each platform.

It works by connecting to both APIs and posting through your account. You are
going to need a bunch of environment variables to setup:

```bash
export 'CONSUMER_KEY'
export 'CONSUMER_SECRET'
export 'BEARER_TOKEN_X'
export 'ACCESS_TOKEN'
export 'ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'
export 'BLUESKY_HANDLE'
export 'BLUESKY_PASSWORD'
```

I am using `uv` to run the script in a self contained manner and you can run it
in the following way:

```bash
uv run single_poster.py "<message>"
```

I then used `alias`:

```bash
alias post='uv run single_poster.py'
```

So that I can just post with:

```bash
post "<thought>"
```

I might add more funcionality in the future but for now it's already doing it's
job! The code can be found [here](https://github.com/snat-s/m/blob/main/bsky/single_poster.py).
