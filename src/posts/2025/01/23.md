It's been really annoying to always have to crosspost around Bluesky and X.
So I decided to fix it. I created a tiny script that uses the X and Bsky APIs
respectively to crosspost through each platform.

It works by connecting to both APIs and posting through your account. You are
going to need a bunch of environment variables to setup:

```bash
export CONSUMER_KEY='dummy_consumer_key'
export CONSUMER_SECRET='dummy_consumer_secret'
export BEARER_TOKEN_X='dummy_bearer_token'
export ACCESS_TOKEN='dummy_access_token'
export ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='dummy_access_token_secret'
export BLUESKY_HANDLE='dummy_bluesky_handle'
export BLUESKY_PASSWORD='dummy_bluesky_password'
```

I am using `uv` to run the script in a self contained manner and you can run it
in the following way:

```bash
uv run /path/to/single_poster.py "<message>"
```

I then used `alias`:

```bash
alias post='uv run single_poster.py'
```

So that I can just post with:

```bash
post "<thought>"
```

I might add more funcionality in the future but for now it's already doing it's
job! The code can be found [here](https://github.com/snat-s/m/blob/main/bsky/single_poster.py).
