One of the cool things about Bluesky right now is that they have an open API.
In this day and age that the internet seems like a bunch of websites with walls as high
as the eye can see. It is nice to have some openness. 

Although it is not a guarantee for this thing to be around for long, for now I am using
it for my needs. In this case, I've started to enjoy a lot RSS, and bsky has it!

So like in 5 minutes I created a tiny script that gives you all of the rss feeds from
a particular account. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/snat-s/m/blob/main/bsky/bsky_feed.py).
And here below too. It is super simple!

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#     "requests",
# ]
# ///
import requests

def main(name="snats.xyz", output_file="following.txt"):
    r = requests.get(f'https://public.api.bsky.app/xrpc/app.bsky.graph.getFollows?actor={name}')
    body = r.json()
    handles = [user['handle'] for user in body['follows']]
    rss_handles = [f"https://bsky.app/profile/{handle}/rss" for handle in handles]
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write('\n'.join(rss_handles))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run all of this with no need to install dependencies and `uv` with a simple:

```bash
uv run bsky_feed.py
```
