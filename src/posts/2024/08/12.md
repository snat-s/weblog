I have a new setup that I will be trying on the following days. It is
incredibly minimalistic. I am currently using a [Boox
10.3](https://shop.boox.com/products/tab) as a monitor and using termux to
ssh into my personal computer. 

How am I currently doing it? Pretty simple. The Boox tablets run Android
inside and let you run any app under the sun. So I have installed the two
most helpful apps one can have in here. 

1. Termux: a terminal emulator for android.
2. Tailscale: A private VPN.

With this two apps, one can use their main computers as a remote server and
just ssh from the tablet! I am starting to try it out, but I still don't
have any strong opinions of if it is feasably a good every day carry or if
it simply to minimal for day to day tasks.

As for the keyboard, I have been using a [CIDOO
v65](cidootech.com/products/cidoo-v65). 

I will keep you all posted, and if it is not a good idea I'll let you know
too!
