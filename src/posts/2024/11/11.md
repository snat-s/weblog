I finally removed my habit of checking social media and replaced it with
checking out a lot of good blogs and essays. I am back to link blogging!
At least for the time being.

So without further a do, I'll start with some essays I really liked:

- [Ozempic but for sleep](https://isaak.net/sleepless/): I want this in my
  life, I love to sleep, but I am an abnormal sleeper. I tend to sleep at least
  for 8 to 10 hours a day. Mind you, I feel amazing, but it sometimes feels
      like way to much time is spent just on sleeping.

- [Every Arthouse Buff You Know Is Pirating
  Films](https://i-d.co/article/streaming-arthouse-movies-john-waters-netflix-2024/):
  I stopped watching art house films because it just was to much of a hassel. I
  read a lot more now a days and I felt identified with this.

- [Mitochondria Are Alive](https://www.asimov.press/p/mitochondria): An
  educated opinion on why Mitochondria are actually alive and well. It goes
  into a solid overview of the history of Mitochondria. For people like me that
  stopped their biology studies in Highschool it is a perfect introduction to
  deeper questions.

- [Scientific Speed Reading: How to Read 300% Faster in 20
  Minutes](https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/):
  An old blogpost by Tim Ferris on how to speed Read. I am a fairly slow reader
  but this helped me a lot. I feel like there is a difference
  between skimming and your reading comprehension going up but this felt like a
  nice reading boost.

- [New Elliptic Curve Breaks 18-Year-Old
  Record](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-elliptic-curve-breaks-18-year-old-record-20241111/):
  An introduction to Eliptic Curves and how they broke the current record. I
  love that we still don't know what's the limit so this kind of competitions
  make it fun.

This is it for now, have fun! I might end up adding some more stuff, but this
is going to start being more of a daily occurance! Btw, if you like it,
remember that RSS is still a thing! You can subscribe that way! If you are on
Android, I can't recommend enough
[CapyReader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.capyreader.app),
it is pretty good and free!
