I recently wrote a tiny image sequence to GIF generator because I
needed it for a blog post I'm writing about optimizing images
from CLIP models. It is super simple, it only has pillow and the std
as a dependency.

It is is a simple CLI tool that accepts two different arguments:
the input directory (`-i`) and the output gif (`-o`).

```bash
python gif.py -i path/to/image/folder -o my_gif.gif
```

I use it with ordered image sequences like 1,2,3...N. 

If you ever use it, please let me know!

It is in my monorepo and can be found [here](https://github.com/snat-s/m/tree/main/imgseq2gif).
