I have been trying to learn a new language in my free time. Right now, my decision is French because it doesn't seem that hard. The website I am using is called [french by french](https://frenchbyfrench.com/). 

For some reason I thought that at some point in my life it would be fun to learn Latin. This website, called [the latin library](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/). It is to my knowledge one of the most complete libraries on latin. They have a course that seems to have a steep learning curve.
