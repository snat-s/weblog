- [Asterisk mag](https://asteriskmag.com/): My summary would be that they write concisely about anything and everything.
- [Asimov press](https://press.asimov.com/): I really hope we get high quality material from this guy's. Biology is super interesting and I want to learn more of it in a fun and educational setting.
- [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/): I feel like this guy's are the most serious right now about publishing high quality educational material of mathematics, computer science and biology.

I found about [midlibrary](midlibrary.io) a place to find prompts for midjourney.
