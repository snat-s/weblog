Sometimes the web is a bit boring. I recently learned about [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) a CSS modifier. You can basically do skins on any website. The community has a lot of themes for most of the places I frequent.

It is incredible how much better and responsive something like Whatsapp can be with a new theme.
