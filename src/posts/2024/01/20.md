I came across [NNCP](https://bellard.org/nncp/). This is an ml model that is on top of the leaderboard in the [Large Text Compression Benchmark](http://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html).

I want to do a more structured blog post, where I implement and explain this compression model so keep your heads up for that.
