I like a good old webring. If you don't know, a webring is a collection of websites that agree to link to a each other. Normally there is a theme and you can check out other members of the webring through a "main" webring page.

Here are some that I know of and sometimes visit.

- [Webring xxiivv](https://webring.xxiivv.com/): One of the duo of [100 rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html) is part of this webring. That is how I found out it existed.
- [Hot-line Webring](https://hotlinewebring.club/): I just discovered it and I want to do a deeper dive for it. Bit it looks nice.

I know that [neocities](https://neocities.org/) has several webrings but I did not feel like searching for them. Maybe I'll later do an entry on it.
