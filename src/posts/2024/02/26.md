Over the past year, I have acumulated a list of different places where
you can get high quality datasets. This is the list in no particular
order on where to get data for different type of problems.

- [Dataset Research Engine by
Google](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/): You might never have
heard of it, but Google has a search engine specifically for datasets. The
results vary, but it can be a good starting point.

- [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/): A hub from anything from models
to super intricate datasets. In general, I use this more for Deep Learning
than for ML.

- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): It is a community / competition
playground from Google. Some of the datasets are really high quality
but it can be really mixed. They have some high quality ML datasets.

- [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets): In here, there
are a lot of what could be considered the classic datasets. The datasets
that you normally use to demonstrate State of the Art on a new method. It
is more academic. Normally it is high quality.

- [Data in Brief](https://www.data-in-brief.com): This is way more
academic. It is an open access journal that is about open data.

- [Data world](https://data.world/): It feels a bit spammy, and the
results can be mixed.

- [Health Data](https://healthdata.gov/): Health data from the US.
