I have made a new enhancement to the way I study. I was using transcripts to compliment my notes in university using LLMs. It is a rather simple approach, you can read more [here](https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/enhancing_lecture_notes_with_ai.html) (maybe not even worth it as a main blog entry). But, I wanted to learn a little bit about working with structured outputs with LLMs. So I made a tiny website that can generate a .csv (compatible with Anki) of questions and answers from any .txt files. I might work a bit more on the website, but it can be found at ankiforge: [here](https://ankiforge.onrender.com/).

I might end up writing a more structured blog post in the future, for now, this is the main entry.
