![Vizualising the pdf corpus](./embeddings_pdf_corpus.png)

Here is a visualization of roughly 8.3 million unique PDF urls. I was bored
like two months ago and wanted to classify pdfs by their metadata. I ended up
generating embeddings for pdf-corpus (the biggest pdf corpus in the world).

I used a tiny model, I used bge-small-en-v1.5 because I ran this on a Kaggle
notebook (sucks to be GPU poor).

I decided to see if you could classify by URL this information because
at the end of the day, the original corpus is 4TB uncompressed and the metadata
is only 1.4GB of text.

More information can be found
[here](https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/file-corpora/cc-main-2021-31-pdf-untruncated/)
and if you want to download the dataset or the metadata it is
[here](https://corp.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/files/CC-MAIN-2021-31-PDF-UNTRUNCATED/).

I might later do a bigger blog post on this. For now, that's it.
